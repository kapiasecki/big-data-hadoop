Hadoop Big Data Project

This project demonstrates how to process and analyze big data using Hadoop, an open-source platform for distributed storage and processing.

Project Overview

- learn about big data concepts and the Hadoop architecture, including MapReduce and HDFS

- create Hadoop Docker images and set up a Hadoop environment in a container

- use Hadoop to handle big data by implementing a word count program

- write a Java program to access and interact with the Hadoop database

Key Skills Gained

- working with distributed data storage and processing

- using Hadoop MapReduce for data analysis

- creating Dockerized Hadoop environments

- writing Java programs to interact with big data systems

Summary

This project provides hands-on experience in big data processing, showcasing the ability to set up Hadoop, process data with MapReduce, and programmatically access distributed datasets.
